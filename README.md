# Duplicate Image Remover
Designed to search folders for duplicate images and notify the user when a potential duplicate has been found. 
The user will then be able to see details about each image, as well as the images themselves, and choose which 
one to remove, if either.

# Features
Can compare images of different sizes with each other.


When a potential duplicate had been found:

The program displays information about each image, including the name of the image, the image path, the image
dimensions, the amount of storage space used by the image, and the file extension.

The program shows where differences between the two images are found, both by highlighting pixels that are not
exactly the same and by subtracting the images from each other.

The program shows how similar the two images are in a percentage format.
